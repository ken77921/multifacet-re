| ColdStartLib.pm     | A set of classes and functions useful across many scripts |
| *-MASTER.pl         | Scripts that do not include routines from ColdStartLib.pm |
| Include.pl          | A script to merge the appropriate code from ColdStartLib.pm into a -MASTER.pl script |

In general the -MASTER scripts can be run directly if your environment is set up to allow perl to see ColdStartLib. To allow scripts to reside in a single file with no external dependencies, Include.pl will munge together ColdStartLib with the -MASTER file to produce the appropriate script on stdout.

The following MASTER scripts are available:
